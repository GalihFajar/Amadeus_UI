# Amadeus (UI)

### About Amadeus

Amadeus is a system for detecting social distancing violation (prior to COVID-19 protocol).
The system is designed to detect violations that occur in an indoor environment.
Amadeus works by taking signal strength from Bluetooth that scattered around the room (which is attached to each people in the room), detect the location and process it based on (local) regulations.

### In This Repository

This repository contains the interface of the system. Build with NextJS, this interface currently running with dummy data that generated internally, since the system is not completely done. Once the system is completely integrated, the code in this repository may have changes accordingly.
